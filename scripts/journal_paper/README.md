# TODO

*[ ] Fix warnings (e.g. citations)

*[ ] How evaluating, what dataset

*[ ] Averaging out prediction "more precise"

*[ ] Mention speed @ Lamb! inference is second, training a couple of minutes.

*[ ] Probably not show virtual inpainting difference.

*[ ] Move Lamb to other sections

## Not highest prio

*[ ] Prediction averaging, already wrote a little bit for it
(code is super easy though)
